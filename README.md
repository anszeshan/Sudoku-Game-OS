# Sudoku-Game-OS
Sudoku Game with OS concepts 


In this project of Operating system (Sudoku), we have two phases, phase 1 and phase 2. In 
Phase 1 we have to display the invalid boxes in the 9x9 matrix of Sudoku game puzzle, also we 
have to check the invalid rows with values and indexes also same like rows we have to do it with 
columns for columns checking. Thread id is also displaying on the screen with specific output. We 
have to display the cancelled thread which the threads has been cancelled with thread id. The result
has been compared in the end of invalid validations of row columns and matrix values. After that 
we have to count the total number of invalid entries. Also showing checking the value of digits 0 
to 9. Implement this phase 1 with using mutex and threads in the whole project. Mutex for locking 
and unlocking the threads. And threads by passing id value in the function as a args. In phase 2, 
we have to show the original and resultant matrix which we change after removing invalid entries 
from puzzle game and solve it accordingly. After that we have to use threads for cancelation and 
record the track of cancelation of threads and check the total number of invalid entries. Showing 
the total number of threads against each invalid entries as it is the number of invalid entries thatâ€™s
why threads create against each invalid entry also display number of moves for solving the total 
number of moves for solving the puzzle or in other words for removing the invalid entries. At last 
print location and positions of all threads and indexes. We use switch statement for showing
separate menu for phase 1 and 2 and different operations in phase 1 and phase 2 which we are 
showing the output of project basically.
